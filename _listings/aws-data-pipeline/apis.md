description: AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and
  move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premise
  data sources, at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly
  access your data where itrsquo;s stored, transform and process it at scale, and
  efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS,
  Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.nAWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex
  data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available.
  You donrsquo;t have to worry about ensuring resource availability, managing inter-task
  dependencies, retrying transient failures or timeouts in individual tasks, or creating
  a failure notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to move and process
  data that was previously locked up in on-premise data silos.
